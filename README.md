Project Euler 12 - 29-Mar-2019

    Take the subset of natural numbers that are the triangle numbers.
    Find the least member of the triangle numbers such that the number
    of divisors is greater than 500. The number of divisors includes
    1 and the number itself.
    
    Note that a triangle number is of the form n(n+1)/2, with n being
    a member of the natural numbers.
    
    Another way of computing the sequence of triangle numbers is:
    1: 1
    2: 1 + 2
    3: 1 + 2 + 3
    4: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
    5: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    etc.
